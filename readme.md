## Overview

This is the basic structure of my personal site. For security reasons - wp-config file is modified, so essential data is hidden.

This is the built version of the site. If you are interested in how the scripts and styles are written - better have 
a look at the `develop` branch.

## Scripts and styles

For the construction of this project, the bare bones "pesticide" theme was used. I've added 
foundation and was influenced heavily by the Hlebarovpress theme, property of hlebarov.com

## Future plans
For starters - I plan to remove completely foundation, as it currently burdens the project 
with quite a lot of outdated technologies.

## Copyright
Barely any. I'd probably be mildly irritated if you use this code without 
mentioning the author or his permission.
